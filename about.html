      I like writing codes and Python is my favourite programming language. I like sharing my knowledge and that is the primary reason to create this blog. I also like reading, travelling and clicking some good <a href="http://pgyogesh.com/photography" target="_blank"> photos</a> on my mobile.

      I hope you enjoyed your stay ðŸ˜Š
